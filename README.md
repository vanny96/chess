This is the final project of the 'Ruby Programming' course on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/ruby-final-project).

With this project my aim was to use everything I learned in order to produce the best code I could, not only a working game. I'm quite satisfied with how it ended up, I had a clear vision on how to code this game and the final result is very close to how I tought it would be.

Anyway I know that the code could be improved massively in terms of algorithms, readability, DRY-philosophy and more and I'll spend a bit of time trying to improve it before moving on with the course.

To play it, run 'ruby play_game.rb' in the command line while in the directory, once you've done this the game will tell you what to do in order to move pieces around

Features to add:    
-Save and load game (partially already implemented)    
-Pieces power-up on enemy base-line
